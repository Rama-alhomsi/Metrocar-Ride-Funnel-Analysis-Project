### **Metrocar Ride Funnel Analysis Project**

This project focuses on analyzing the ride funnel of **Metrocar**, a ride-sharing service, with the aim of identifying drop-off rates at different stages of the user journey and providing actionable insights for improving conversion rates. The analysis uses data from ride requests, user transactions, and reviews, applying descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to highlight critical areas of drop-off and engagement.

#### **Project Goals**
The primary objective is to understand user behavior throughout the Metrocar ride funnel and propose data-driven recommendations to:
- Increase the conversion rate from ride requests to completed rides.
- Optimize the signup and ride acceptance process.
- Improve driver performance and rider satisfaction.

#### **Data Pipeline**
The project uses the following datasets:
- **User Data:** Information about users who downloaded the app, signed up, and requested rides.
- **Ride Requests:** Data on ride requests, acceptance, and completion, including timestamps.
- **Transactions:** Details of payment success or failure for completed rides.
- **Reviews:** Customer reviews that indicate rider sentiment and overall experience.

#### **Funnel Stages**
1. **Signup**
2. **Ride Requested**
3. **Ride Accepted**
4. **Ride Completed**
5. **Payment Success**
6. **Review Given**

Each stage was analyzed to calculate the conversion rates and identify where users drop off. A significant finding was a **49% drop-off** rate between the **Ride Accepted** and **Ride Completed** stages, requiring deeper investigation into factors such as driver availability, ride cancellations, and user experience.

#### **Key Insights**
- **Signup to Ride Request Conversion:** A **25%** drop-off rate from app download to signup, indicating potential friction in the signup process.
- **High Ride Acceptance Rate:** A **99% acceptance** rate shows that drivers are readily available, but user engagement drops between acceptance and ride completion.
- **Drop-Off in Ride Completion:** Almost **50%** of users cancel rides or fail to complete them after ride acceptance.
- **Age Group Consistency:** No major differences in funnel performance across various age groups, but over **50%** drop off before completing the signup.
- **Revenue Opportunities:** iOS users display higher engagement and revenue potential than Android users, suggesting that **budget allocation** should focus on the iOS market.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **App Optimization:** Simplify the signup process and improve the user experience to reduce friction.
2. **Driver Engagement:** Ensure consistent driver availability, reduce waiting times, and provide incentives to drivers for completing rides.
3. **Targeted Marketing:** Focus on iOS users, given their higher engagement rates and revenue potential.
4. **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement surge pricing strategies during peak demand hours to optimize revenue while maintaining a high conversion rate from ride requests to payments.
